Crypto Bank

Banks are built on trust.  The trusted middleman of money transfer.  It is the center of personal finance and corporate finance.

Banks provide more than a "place to put your money."  They provide loans, escrow services, checks against amounts, transfer of money, cutting checks to individuals or businesses, activity reports, and can change who controls funds.  They also can make loans using deposit assets for a variety of types of loans including car loans, home loans, business loans, etc.

Technology makes banks efficient but of course adds a layer of risk.  Banks have layers of technical security mediated of course by their own secured records.  As such, APIs against bank funds corporately and personally are not aways very open.  Security-first is a good approach to preserving your money.

Crypto bank is an open-source project that aims to create a API first bank that fullfulls all functions of a bank from the "hodling" of your money, to the transfer of funds, to the escrow and loan services.  Also, secure financial records that have financial impact - like "who invested" in this entity, how much money has passed through the entity, how much is owed to and from the organization.

It will be API-first making it very easy for online companies to use the service in addition to end-customers using the bank. 

- Ideally the bank would have a mobile and web presence not unlike current offerings.  
- Records would be kept on public widely distributed decentralized blockchains with low concentration ideally.
- Protocols / blockchains would be interchangable so newer technology could be incorporated by the bank, but also so that future users of the code of the bank could simply swap out protocols / blockchains without having to fork and make significant changes to the code.  (ie. pre-baking flexibility to maintain cohesion of developer community to create strength to crypto bank code base, allow crypto bank operator flexibility, and in-the end allow users choice.  The added benefit of course would be the interoperability of the crypto banking network - escrow, loans, paybacks, verications, payments - so much of the value depends on the network effects (interoperability) of the financial network.
